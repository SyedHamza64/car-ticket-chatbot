Hi [Client], thanks for asking about the retrieval settings.

The system handles your limited dataset (19 tickets) well. When you set "number of tickets" to 3, it uses semantic search to find the 3 most relevant tickets based on meaning - not random. With 19 tickets, retrieving 3-5 means getting 16-26% of the database (the most relevant ones per query).

The system compensates for limited tickets by relying more on the 83 guide sections as the primary knowledge base. It handles this gracefully - requesting more tickets than available simply returns all available tickets without errors.

I recommend increasing to 5 tickets + 5 guides (instead of 3+3) for better coverage while maintaining fast responses. All ticket data is stored locally in ChromaDB - no external APIs access your tickets. Your privacy concerns are fully addressed with local storage.

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust the default settings or if you have any other questions.
